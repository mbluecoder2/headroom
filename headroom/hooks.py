"""Compression Hooks — extension points for customizing compression behavior.

Three hooks at well-defined pipeline stages:

1. pre_compress: modify messages before compression (dedup, filter, inject)
2. compute_biases: set per-message compression aggressiveness (position-aware, phase-aware)
3. post_compress: observe results after compression (learning, analytics, logging)

Default implementation is no-op — OSS behavior unchanged. Override these
in a subclass to customize (e.g., Headroom SaaS implements position-aware
compression and cross-turn deduplication via these hooks).

Usage:
    from headroom.hooks import CompressionHooks, CompressContext

    class MyHooks(CompressionHooks):
        def compute_biases(self, messages, ctx):
            # Position-aware: keep more in the middle (attention is weakest there)
            biases = {}
            for i in range(len(messages)):
                pos = i / max(len(messages) - 1, 1)
                biases[i] = 1.0 + 0.5 * (1.0 - abs(2 * pos - 1))
            return biases

    config = ProxyConfig(hooks=MyHooks())
